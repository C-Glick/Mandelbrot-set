# Mandelbrot-set
A Java program to visualize the Mandelbrot set.

The base equation: z=z<sup>2</sup>+c

Where c is the complex number to test and z is initally 0+0i. Iterate the equation until |z| > 2.

The number of iterations determains the color of point c. If z does not exceed 2 within a finite number of iterations, the point is said to be within the Mandelbrot set and is colored black.
